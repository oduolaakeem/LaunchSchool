# Excercises from the Variables section of the book.

# out a greeting message with their name included.
# see file name.rb

# 2. Write a program called age.rb that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years.
# Below is the ouput for someone 20 years old.

# 3. Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 time. You must do this without explicity writing the 
# puts method 10 times in a row.

# 4. Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user fot their first name, saves into a variable, and then does the same for the last name.
# Then outputs their full name all at once.
