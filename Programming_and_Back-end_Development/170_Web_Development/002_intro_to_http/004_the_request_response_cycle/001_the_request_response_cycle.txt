Example:
todos.com

Request
Method:     GET

the request.

After receiving the request, the server will perform some tasks, like...

  - Verify user session
  - Load tasks from database
  - Render HTML
  
Then sends back the Response

Response
Status      200 OK
Headers     ContentType: text/html
Body        <html><body>

Finally the browser will render the response for the user.
