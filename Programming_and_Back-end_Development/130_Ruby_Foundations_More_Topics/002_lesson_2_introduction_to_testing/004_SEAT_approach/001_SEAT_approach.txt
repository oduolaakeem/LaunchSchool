In the previous assignments, we've been quickly diving down into the tests and
assertions, but in larger projects, there are usually 4 steps to writing a test:

1. Set up the necessary objects.
2. Execute the code against the object we're testing.
3. Assert the results of the execution.
4. Tear down and clean up any lingering artifacts.
