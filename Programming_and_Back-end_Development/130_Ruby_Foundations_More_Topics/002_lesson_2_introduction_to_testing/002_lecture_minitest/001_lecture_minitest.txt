Vocabulary

In the world of testing, a whole new vocabulary is necessary to talk about the
new concepts. There is a lot of jargon when working with tests, but for
now, we'll just focus on a few terms below.

Test Suite: this is the entire set of tests that accompanies your program or
application. You can think of this as all the tests for a project.

Test: this describes a situation or context in which tests are run.
For example, this test is about making sure you get an error message
after trying to log in with the wrong password. A test can contain multiple assertions.

Assertion: this is the actual verification step to confirm that the data
returned by your program or application is indeed what is expected. You make
one or more assertions within a test.
