Approach to OOP

The classical approach to object oriented programming is:

1. Write a textual description of the problem or exercise.
2. Extract the major nouns and verbs from the description.
3. Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns.
4. The nouns are the classes and the verbs are the behaviors or methods.

Game textual description:

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player chooses one of 
three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The chosen moves will then 
be compared to see who wins, according to the following rules:

- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock

If the players chose the same move, then it's a tie.

Approach

  Nouns: player, move, rule
  Verbs: choose, compare

Orginizing the verbs and the nouns.

  Player
   - choose
  Move
