example 1: A method that returns the sum of two integers

START

SET number1 = GET number from user
SET number2 = GET number from user

SET result = number1 + number 2

PRINT result

END

example 2: A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those string concatenated together

START

SET iterator = 1
SET string = empty

WHILE iterator < array_of_strings length
  SET string = string + array_of_strings(iterator position)

PRINT string

END

example 3: A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

START

SET iterator = 1
SET empty array new_array

WHILE iterator < array_of_integers
  ADD array_of_integers(iterator) to new_array
  
PRINT new_array

END
